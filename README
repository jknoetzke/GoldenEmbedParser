    This is the Java parser for the GoldenEmbed project. It contains two
main git branches. The first (master) is for the main GoldenEmbed Project.
The second (gps) is for GoldenEmbedGPS (GEGPS). 

    The goal for these two branches is to simply parse the data left on
the SD card from the GoldenEmbed(GPS) project. The format for the data on the
card is as such:

For GoldenEmbed (v1) the format is very simple. The data is simply a raw stream
of ANT+ data and ends in an RTC timestamp (HR MINUTE SECOND). One byte 
represents HOUR another for MINUTE and another byte for SECOND.

    To know more of the ANT+ protocol see: http://www.thisisant.com

For GoldenEmbedGPS (v2 or GEGPS) the message conists of the raw ANT+ data
followed by LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, DATE and TIME.

An example for GE V1 would be:

ANT+ A4 03 40 01 51 00 B7
TIME: 17 33 34 (Elapsed timer from the start)


An example message for GE v2 would be as such:

ANT+:      A4 03 40 01 51 00 B7 
LATITUDE:  34 35 33 32 2E 31 30 38 33 00 00 00 00 00 00 
LONGITUDE: 30 37 33 33 34 2E 35 32 31 34 00 00 00 00 00 
DATE+TIME:      0B 01 0C 17 33 34 (UTC)
